### Objectives
- Test cross-region replication functionality
- Simulate disaster recovery scenarios
- Validate business continuity capabilities

### Verify Cross-Region Replication

1. **Check primary bucket** (us-east-1):
   - Note current backup files and count
   - Upload a test file to verify replication

2. **Check secondary bucket** (us-west-2):
   - Switch AWS Console region to us-west-2
   - Navigate to secondary S3 bucket
   - ✅ Verify all backup files replicated
   - ✅ Verify test file replicated within 5 minutes

### Simulate Primary Region Failure

**Scenario**: Primary region becomes unavailable

1. **Document current state**:
   - Count items in each DynamoDB table
   - Note latest backup timestamps
   - Record current data checksums

2. **Simulate data loss**:
   - Delete some items from `app-users` table
   - Record what was deleted for validation

3. **Recovery from secondary region**:
   - Switch to us-west-2 region
   - Access replicated backup files
   - Use recovery function with secondary bucket

### Test Recovery Process

1. **Create temporary recovery function** in us-west-2:
   - Copy `enhanced-recovery-orchestrator` to us-west-2
   - Update environment variables to use secondary bucket

2. **Execute recovery**:
   ```json
   {
     "table_name": "app-users",
     "backup_bucket": "serverless-backup-secondary-[yourname]"
   }
   ```

3. **Validate recovery**:
   - ✅ Verify deleted items restored
   - ✅ Check data integrity with checksums
   - ✅ Confirm item counts match pre-failure state

### Calculate Recovery Metrics

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**:
- Time from failure detection to service restoration
- Target: < 15 minutes
- ✅ Measure actual time taken

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**:
- Maximum acceptable data loss
- Target: < 24 hours (last backup)
- ✅ Verify no data loss beyond last backup

**Disaster Recovery Testing**: Regular DR testing is crucial. In production, you should test your disaster recovery procedures at least quarterly.
