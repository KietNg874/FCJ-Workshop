## Why Serverless for Backup & Disaster Recovery?

### Traditional Backup Challenges
- **Infrastructure Management**: Maintaining backup servers, storage systems, and networking
- **Scaling Issues**: Manual scaling during peak backup windows
- **Cost Inefficiency**: Paying for idle resources during non-backup periods
- **Complexity**: Managing multiple tools and systems for different backup types
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Patching, updating, and monitoring backup infrastructure

### Serverless Advantages
- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: No servers to provision, patch, or maintain
- **Automatic Scaling**: Scales automatically based on workload demands
- **Pay-per-Use**: Only pay for actual compute time and storage used
- **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy and fault tolerance
- **Rapid Development**: Focus on business logic, not infrastructure
- **Integration**: Native integration with AWS services
