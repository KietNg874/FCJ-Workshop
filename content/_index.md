# Serverless Backup & Disaster Recovery Workshop

### Overall
In this comprehensive workshop, you'll build a production-ready serverless backup solution that leverages AWS serverless technologies to provide automated, scalable, and cost-effective data protection. Learn how to implement disaster recovery strategies using AWS Lambda, Step Functions, S3, DynamoDB, and other managed services.

### What You'll Learn
- Build serverless backup solutions using AWS Lambda and Step Functions
- Implement cross-region disaster recovery with S3 replication
- Create automated backup workflows with EventBridge scheduling
- Develop data validation and integrity checking processes
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting with CloudWatch and SNS
- Design RESTful APIs for backup operations using API Gateway
- Apply security best practices with IAM roles and encryption

### Expected Outcomes
By the end of this workshop, you'll have built:
- **3 Lambda Functions**: Backup, validation, and recovery functions
- **2 S3 Buckets**: Primary and secondary with cross-region replication
- **3 DynamoDB Tables**: Source data with sample records
- **1 Step Functions Workflow**: Orchestrated backup process
- **EventBridge Rules**: Daily and weekly backup schedules
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for backup operations
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
